Welcome to Khet-Shut: A Digital Twin SDK for Robotic Vehicles
*************************************************************

Khet-Shut and Ka
================
In ancient egyptian language, *Khet-Shut* translates to *Physical-Shadow* which is the purpose of our project. We aim to seamlessly give life to a physical-digital system for robotic vehicles.

The Project
============
Building digital twins for drones is not a trivial task and it requires a specific pipeline to be followed as well as specific hardware and software components. 
Our project aims to provide a Software Development Kit (SDK) that will help developers to build digital twins for automated vehicles whether they be robotic or aeronautic.

The project uses the concept of a dockerized private cloud to host the dashboard and the Namespace that establish the bidirectional communication aka the digital twin

.. The technical aspects of the project is described in the :ref:`overview`

.. See the :ref:`setting_up` for more information on getting started with the SDK.

.. User Guide
.. ==================
.. See the :ref:`developer_guide` for more information on how to use the SDK.
